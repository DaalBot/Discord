# Privacy Policy
## What we store
By default, DaalBot does not store any data with a few exceptions. If someone with the correct permissions were to run a command like /logs the data entered into that command will be stored in the bots database in order for the bot to do its function in this case logging events in the server.

No other data relating to the server is stored except for events like the bot being added / removed from the server which will send a log to a private channel and contains the server name and ID. 

DaalBot does not store any data about the users in the server except for when needed like tracking certain aspects of a user in the server but this data is never sent to logs of any kind.
