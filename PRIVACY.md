# Privacy Policy
## What we store
By default, DaalBot does not store any data with the exception of data that is needed for the bot to function. This data is stored in a database and is only accessible by the bot owner.

No other data relating to the server is stored except for events like the bot being added / removed from the server which will send a log to a private channel and contains the server name and ID. 

DaalBot does not store any data about the users in the server except for when needed like tracking certain aspects of a user in the server but this data is never sent to logs of any kind.

## How the data is stored
The data is stored in **plain text** in a folder on the bots server and mongodb. The data is only accessible by the bot owner and is not shared with anyone else.

## 3rd party services
DaalBot sometimes reaches out to 3rd party services to store / retrieve data. You can see what services are used and find links to their sites where you can find a privacy policy.

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Used to store data like warns

## Questions and removal
